# Polish-Companies-Bankruptcy-Prediction

This repository contains the project for the course Statistical Learning for Engineers, focusing on predicting bankruptcy in Polish companies using machine learning models built from scratch. The project explores multiple machine learning techniques to handle imbalanced data and improve prediction accuracy.

Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy in Polish companies based on a variety of financial features. We developed and evaluated machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines, without relying on sklearn libraries. We incorporated various data preprocessing techniques and used SMOTE for oversampling to address the class imbalance in the dataset.

Repository Structure

	•	Code File: Contains the complete Python code for data preprocessing, feature selection, and the implementation of machine learning models from scratch.

	•	Project Report (PDF): The final project report detailing the methodology, experiments, and results.
	•	Project Presentation (PDF): A concise presentation of the project findings and conclusions.

Key Components

	1.	Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature selection, and SMOTE oversampling to handle imbalanced classes.
	2.	Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM, all implemented from scratch.
	3.	Evaluation Metrics: The models are evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess predictive performance.

Getting Started

To run the code, simply download the repository and execute the main script in the code file. The dataset should be located in the Dataset folder.

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.x
	•	Standard libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.
